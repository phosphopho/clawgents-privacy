<h1>Privacy Policy — Clawgents</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>Clawgents ("the app") is a free idle game published on Google Play. This policy explains what data is collected, by whom, and how it is used.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect Directly</h2>
<p>The app stores your game progress (agent levels, upgrade state, boost history) <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using Android SharedPreferences. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.</p>

<h2>Data Collected by Third Parties</h2>

<p><strong>Google AdMob (advertising)</strong><br>
The app displays rewarded video advertisements served by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device identifiers (Advertising ID, IP address) and usage signals to serve relevant ads. You can opt out of personalised advertising in your device's Google Settings. See Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<p><strong>Google Play Billing (in-app purchases)</strong><br>
In-app purchases are processed entirely by Google Play. We do not receive or store your payment information. Google's handling of purchase data is governed by Google's privacy policy above.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Game save data is stored locally and is deleted when you uninstall the app. We have no server-side storage.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because we do not collect or hold personal data, there is nothing for us to delete or export on request. For data held by Google AdMob, please contact Google directly through their privacy controls.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. Changes will be reflected by the date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
